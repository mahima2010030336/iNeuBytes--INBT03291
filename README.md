Task - 1: Implement a Machine Learning Model for the Classification problem.
Dataset link - https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ineubytes/heart-disease-dataset
The Kaggle "Heart Disease Dataset" is a collection of information about people's hearts. It has details like age, gender, and medical measurements like blood pressure and cholesterol. This data helps doctors and scientists study heart disease and find ways to keep hearts healthy.
These are the columns of dataset:
1.	Age: The age of the patient.
2.	Sex: The gender of the patient (0 for female, 1 for male).
3.	Chest Pain Type (cp): The type of chest pain experienced by the patient.
4.	Resting Blood Pressure (trestbps): The resting blood pressure of the patient.
5.	Serum Cholesterol Level (chol): The serum cholesterol level of the patient.
6.	Fasting Blood Sugar (fbs): Fasting blood sugar level (> 120 mg/dl or <= 120 mg/dl).
7.	Resting Electrocardiographic Results (restecg): Resting electrocardiographic results.
8.	Maximum Heart Rate Achieved (thalach): The maximum heart rate achieved during exercise.
9.	Exercise-Induced Angina (exang): Whether exercise-induced angina was present (0 for no, 1 for yes).
10.	ST Depression (oldpeak): ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest.
11.	Slope of the Peak Exercise ST Segment (slope): The slope of the peak exercise ST segment.
12.	Number of Major Vessels Colored by Fluoroscopy (ca): The number of major vessels colored by fluoroscopy.
13.	Thalassemia Type (thal): The type of thalassemia.
14.	Presence of Heart Disease (target): The presence of heart disease (0 for no, 1 for yes).

Task - 2: Implement a Machine Learning Model for the Regression problem
Dataset Link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ineubytes/pm25-airpolution-dataset
This dataset describes about air pollution, specifically the levels of PM2.5 (particulate matter) in the air. PM2.5 is tiny particles that can be harmful when inhaled. This provides data over time, including factors like temperature, humidity, and wind speed, which can influence pollution levels. It also includes the location or city where the measurements were taken. This can be used to study air quality, identify trends, and understand how various factors impact PM2.5 levels, helping to address air pollution and its effects on health.
These are the columns of dataset:
1.	No represents row numbers in the dataset.
2.	year indicates the year of the data in the row.
3.	month specifies the month of the data in the row.
4.	day denotes the day of the data in the row.
5.	hour indicates the hour of the data in the row.
6.	pm2.5 represents PM2.5 concentration in micrograms per cubic meter (ug/m^3).
7.	DEWP corresponds to Dew Point temperature in degrees Celsius (°C).
8.	TEMP refers to Temperature in degrees Celsius (°C).
9.	PRES signifies atmospheric Pressure in hectopascals (hPa).
10.	cbwd describes Combined wind direction.
11.	Iws represents Cumulated wind speed in meters per second (m/s).
12.	Is signifies Cumulated hours of snow.
13.	Ir indicates Cumulated hours of rain.

Major Project Task: Predictive Analysis and Customer Segmentation for an E-Commerce Platform.
Dataset Link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ineubytes/online-retail-ecommerce-dataset   
An online retail e-commerce dataset is a collection of structured data that records various aspects of online retail transactions and customer interactions with an e-commerce platform. Such datasets are commonly used for analyzing sales patterns, customer behavior, inventory management, and other aspects of e-commerce business operations.
These are the columns of dataset:
1.	InvoiceNo: An identifier for each retail transaction.
2.	StockCode: A code representing the product in the transaction.
3.	Description: A description of the product.
4.	Quantity: The quantity of the product purchased in the transaction.
5.	InvoiceDate: The date and time when the transaction occurred.
6.	UnitPrice: The price of a single unit of the product.
7.	CustomerID: A unique identifier for each customer.
8.	Country: The country where the customer is located or where the transaction took place.
